About Dataset: 
The "Daily Transactions" dataset contains information on dummy transactions made by
an individual on a daily basis. The dataset includes data on the products that were
purchased, the amount spent on each product, the date and time of each transaction,
the payment mode of each transaction, and the source of each record
(Expense/Income).
This dataset can be used to analyze purchasing behavior and money management,
forecasting expenses, and optimizing savings and budgeting strategies. The dataset is
well-suited for data analysis and machine learning applications,it can be used to train
predictive models and make data-driven decisions.

Column Descriptors:

● Date: The date and time when the transaction was made   
● Mode: The payment mode used for the transaction

● Category: Each record is divided into a set of categories of transactions

● Subcategory: Categories are further broken down into Subcategories of transactions

● Note: A brief description of the transaction made

● Amount: The transactional amount

● Income/Expense: The indicator of each transaction representing either expense or income

● Currency: All transactions are recorded in official currency of India


Let's outline a financial analyst project that involves working with a dataset of
daily transactions. We'll include steps to clean the data, perform analysis, and generate
a report with code examples in Python using popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy,
Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
